    <p><strong>Task Description:</strong></p>

        <p> Digital Management System is a part of Amadeus Social Media Suite where user could manage images, PDF
            files, and youtube videos. Within the system user can either edit the files or simply share them to the
            social sites
            which are connected with the system.
        </p>

        <p>
            Same as all old components in Amadeus Social Media Suite, design was not optimised for users, some
            functionalities are hidden, working processes are not smooth. There are died points, unclear steps
            and miss leading instructions etc. A brand new, simplified modern design is needed.

            <p>
                The functional list I got from Product Manager was really long, and it took me quite a while to find them
                out one by one in old system.
                <strong> But it worth spending time to dig up all those functions and then
                    target main design problems there.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                The biggest problem I found out in the old design is that all the media types (photo, docs, PDFs,
                youtube videos) are mixed in one list view without having any signifier which tells user who they are.
                And it became worse, because different type has different functionalities. For exmaple, due to technical limitations, the system doesn't
                support direct video uploading from users' computer, users can only Synchronize their Youtube Channels in
                order to have videos in system. And in the old design, there is
                no way users would find out this information. What they could do is repeatedly trying to upload videos and then
                got some error messages which they don't understand, finally became angry. Those hidden-functionalities
                problems are quite common in the old design. <strong> So the first thing I did before designing is to
                restructure the functions, and group them in a more
                user friendly way. Depends on file types, and depends on function types, separate them into different
                groups/UI-groups. </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong> I imagined myself as user, give me several task I want to do. For example, upload a photo, edit
                    a photo, synchronize a youtube video, create a collection. </strong> In this way, I broke functionalities into
                several  groups. Each group has a different UI for users to accomplish some similar tasks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Last but not least, <strong> I used a red pen to market out what were the problems in old design for each
                functionality, to remind myself to avoid them in the new design.</strong>
            </p>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

            <p>
                Sketching is my favorite part during design process. <strong> Any flash idea can be
                captured by
                just drawing lines on a paper.</strong> Usually, I draw fast, only-readable by myself wireframes at the beginning stage. I draw at
                least 5 different ideas, no matter they are good or not. And then analyse them,
                select one or two which I like most, redo the wireframe again. After that I would spend hours looking at
                them:
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong> Imagine what I would do if I was a user, how could I do it. Is there any places that I will
                    get stuck? Is there buttons/links/icons I need to think before I click? </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                After this step. I will finalize my wireframes. If there are still
                more than one options, for example, the overview of Digital Management System (See the image
                below),<strong> I
                will write down advantages and disadvantages of each single design to help me making the finally
                decision.</strong>

            <span class="title-prefix">During Design - phase 2:</span>

        </h2>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
            <p>
                <strong> From my opinion, after having an idea or an image how the design should look like, creating
                    HTML click-dummy usually goes quite smoothly. </strong> Of course you will find out that something
                in the wireframe
                which do not fit with real data and you need to do some adjustments, but the main direction won't change
                much in most of cases.
            </p>

            <p>
                The biggest issue I had in this design task is that there were too many things you could do with photos
                and too much info of photos you should show to users, plus photos themselves are colorful objects
                If I put everything on the surface like my original idea in the
                wirefames, it looks overwhelmed. That is also the main reason why I abandoned the card view before. But
                even for the list view, which has much more space, it looked crowded when I made most functionalities visible
                together with photos. <strong>I really want to give users an impression that, they can have a
                rest here, enjoy looking at beautiful images, take a pause from boring daily works. </strong>
                So finally, I decided to use a hover effect to hide most functions, and give user a clean view when
                they land on this page.

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

            <p>
                After finished the design, I gave the click-dummy to a small group of people who use the old digital
                system daily, and let them play with it freely. The feedback was good. Not many changes during this
                phase were needed, only some small things were pointed out, for example,
                the color of the heart icon and the check icon were not bright enough. When a image had too many
                red/green colors, they were not obvious enough to identify. So I increased the contrast between the
                background grey and icons colors.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some bigger changes came after the development.<strong> With real data, performance were not as good as
                it showed in click-dummy. Sometimes, it is easier to improve it with better design than spending weeks
                kicking off the technical bottle nick</strong> For example, "marking as favorite" button, in
                click-dummy, users see feedback immediately, but in real world it usually takes 2 to 4 seconds to
                get response from server. So during these 2 to 4 seconds, users doesn't know what
                is happening. And they might click again and again on the icon, which of course causes troubles. To
                avoid the confusion, I add an small animation to the icon. After clicking, the icon will spin slowly
                until we get the response from server. <strong> Animation clearly tells users that the icon is already
                being clicked. At the same time, it brings fun.</strong> I found out that some users did enjoy clicking
                on it again and again just to see the animation.
