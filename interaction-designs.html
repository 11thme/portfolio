            Interaction design is what I do most during my work and it is also what I am enjoy doing:
            <br>When users have a problem, I use design to solve the problems in a smooth, beautiful way.
            <br>When users have a desire, I use design to present their dreams into reality.
            <br>When users don't know what they want, I use design to show them how easier and better the world can
            be.

            <h4>Pre-booking Ticket</h4>

            <p>IBE, so called International Booking Engine is widely used by travel agencies across Europe. The goal is
                to make the booking process more social for travellers, to allow them to share booking information
                easily and by that drive more traffic to the travel agency.
            </p>

            <p>
                The task was to create a responsible web page to display basic information about a flight booking. The page should show the price of the flight at the time of sharing and allow user to check the current price.

            <p>Digital Management System is a part of Amadeus Social Media Suite(ASMS) where user can manage images,
                PDF files, and youtube videos. With Digital Management System, user can either edit media files or
                simply share them to
                social sites, such as, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc.
                which are connected with the platform.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a redesign work, the old one has a lot of problems. For example, major functionality are well
                hidden,
                List view is messy, upload process are long etc. I aim to fix all those problems and make use enjoy
                their work of managing media files.

            <h4>User Admin</h4>

            <p>
                User Admin is one of the most complicated part of ASMS. It is used by ASMS Admins who can
                create/edit/delete users of ASMS. It sounds easy, but those users, has multiple accounts, it belongs
                to different companies, and different companies belongs to different groups, and also different
                groups belongs to different market.
                All those information has to display in a clearly understandable ways. At same a user-friendly
                searching functionality between those layer-structures need to be provided.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a redesign work, and a lot of thoughts has been done before the design process starts.

                Click A Pic is a small facebook app, which are given free to all ASMS users. User can choose to
                install this app on their facebook fan page. This is a puzzle games, inside one game, there are
                randomly chosen photos of some tourist place, players has limited time to figure out where it is.

            <p>
                This game requirement is easy, it need to show how beautiful the places are, so that after player
                plays the game, he/she has desire to travel to those places.
                We have a phase-2 plan for this game, it is to link travel package offer to those puzzles and if
                user has won certain amount of guessing, he/she will get some special offers.

        <p><strong>Task Description:</strong></p>

        <p> I got a task to redesign the Admin Manager of Amadeus Social Media Suite ( ASMS: A Management System
            for Travel Industry Companies to manage their social channels ).
        </p>

        <p>
            This Admin Manager is where all registered users display.The user structure in ASMS is complicated,
            it has 5 layers: Market -> Chain -> Travel Agency -> Account -> Travel Agent . Administrator should
            be able to create/edit/delete/search/monitor user, as well its parents.
        </p>

        <p>
            The old design of Admin Manager didn’t show this structure clearly, and some functionality were
            hidden. There were a lot of usability issues, and it was simply ugly. A brand new design is
            required.

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

            <p>
                After a long meeting with product manager, the first thing I did was to ask to reduce the structure
                complexity. I gave product manager two suggestions:
            </p>

            <p>Suggestion 1. Merge Market and Chain. The reason is: Market and Chain are 90% similar and for most
                markets there is only 1 chain for all users.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suggestion 2. Hide Accounts from UI. Because Travel Agent and Account are same from
                Administrator/user’s point of view. The concept behind it is: You can login with “One Account”, and
                then you can switch between different “Travel Agents” which belongs to Different “Travel Agencies”.
                So when create a new “Agent”
                <br> = 1. create a new “Agent” and a new “Account” +assign it to a “Travel Agency”
                <br> = 2. select existing “Agent” + create a new Account to this “Agent”, assign this Account of the
                “Agent” to a “Travel Agency”
                Why not just delete this “Account” layer from surface (it is still in database, just not visible for
                end-user anymore). In this case Administrator don’t need to think anymore: Should I create an
                Account or an Agent? what’s the difference again?

            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, suggestion 2 was taken. Suggestion 1 was refused, because market and chains are two
                different marketing concepts, both are needed for sales team. And we decide to make one more small
                change, use general names instead of travel industry terminology. To sum up, the finally structure
                look like this:

                <br> <strong>Market -> Group -> Company -> User</strong>

                <br> After decision was made, I took a step forward, I make a structure map, combined the required
                functions and the 4-layer structure into one map, which gave me a clear view of the data-structure
                and main functionality.

                For me, design always equals to solving problems, users’ needs are the problems, providing what they
                want is to solve the problems. So here comes to the problem-identifying graph:

                Naturally, after you got the problems, you want solutions. And before you find out the best solutions,
                you have some expectations how the solution might look like. Draw them down fast, just to keep a record.
                So that afterwards, you can use it to verify your final solution. And it is my 3rd graph:

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

            <p>
                <strong>Landing Page:</strong>
                <br>From the “who-wants-what” problem identifying graph, I knew that, System Administrator wants 3
                things: create market/group/company/user, search any of them and edit any of them.
                <br>So for the landing page, I decided to give system administrator all functions in a straightforward
                way. By one look, administrator understand that they can create any entity they want, or search for
                anything they want to view or edit.
            </p>

            <p>
                (note: for monitoring users, because it was not a major function, it has been postponed. )

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <p>
                <strong>Search Functionality:</strong>
                <br>From the landing page, it is simple, users know what they want to search and then they directly go
                to the desired search field. But for displaying search result, it is tricky, how to show the search
                result in a structured way? how could it be easy for users to start a new search in the search result
                page? Searching with the 4-layer structure is not as easy as Google search, displaying everything in a
                list as Google does, won’t help administrators filter out what they want, and give them a overview the
                huge and complex user-system they are managing. So we have to show the 4-layer structure somehow in the
                result page.

                <br>There are two ways to do that:
                <br>1. Structure search results
                <br>2. Structure search queries

                <br>I made two sketch based on those two proposals. And then I imaged some scenarios which System Admin
                might encounter with. And then I applied them with the two solutions. I found out that structuring
                search queries was easier for making a new search and it had a cleaner design.

                of the final solution. To avoid redesign during the HTML click dummy creating stage, I did a mapping

                After the low-fi design was confirmed, I made a HTML click-dummy as usual. Since this design contained a
                lot of text information, I used more white spaces and as less buttons as possible. In order to keep a
                clean design style as other part inside ASMS, at same time it would be more readable for users

                Functional Test: The test was made with one of the product managers from my company, who uses this part
                of system frequently to create new users, new companies etc. At the beginning the test didn't go very
                well, because the interface changed a lot compare to the previous design. And also the tester got used
                to the old complicated way to create new users. She told me, it feels weird, it didn’t meet her
                imagination of the new design. But after a while she adapted to the new interface and had no problems to
                finish all tasks. But still there were some small changes I had to made after the observing the tester’s

                I am also a developer myself, I usually know what can be done and how much time it would take. During
                the design, I did pay attention to not to increase the complicity of development because of design, at
                least I would balance. But this time, developers

            The functional list I got from Product Manager was really long, and it took me quite a while to find them
            out one by one in old system.
            <strong> But it worth spending time to dig up all those functions and then
                target main design problems there.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            The biggest problem I found out in the old design is that all the media types (photo, docs, PDFs,
            youtube videos) are mixed in one list view without having any signifier which tells user who they are.
            And it became worse, because different type has different functionalities. For exmaple, due to technical
            limitations, the system doesn't
            support direct video uploading from users' computer, users can only Synchronize their Youtube Channels in
            order to have videos in system. And in the old design, there is
            no way users would find out this information. What they could do is repeatedly trying to upload videos and
            then
            got some error messages which they don't understand, finally became angry. Those hidden-functionalities
            problems are quite common in the old design. <strong> So the first thing I did before designing is to
            restructure the functions, and group them in a more
            user friendly way. Depends on file types, and depends on function types, separate them into different
            groups/UI-groups. </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> I imagined myself as user, give me several task I want to do. For example, upload a photo, edit
                a photo, synchronize a youtube video, create a collection. </strong> In this way, I broke
            functionalities into
            several groups. Each group has a different UI for users to accomplish some similar tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Last but not least, <strong> I used a red pen to market out what were the problems in old design for each
            functionality, to remind myself to avoid them in the new design.</strong>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

        <p>
            Sketching is my favorite part during design process. <strong> Any flash idea can be
            captured by
            just drawing lines on a paper.</strong> Usually, I draw fast, only-readable by myself wireframes at the
            beginning stage. I draw at
            least 5 different ideas, no matter they are good or not. And then analyse them,
            select one or two which I like most, redo the wireframe again. After that I would spend hours looking at
            them:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> Imagine what I would do if I was a user, how could I do it. Is there any places that I will
                get stuck? Is there buttons/links/icons I need to think before I click? </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            After this step. I will finalize my wireframes. If there are still
            more than one options, for example, the overview of Digital Management System (See the image
            below),<strong> I
            will write down advantages and disadvantages of each single design to help me making the finally
            decision.</strong>

    </h2>

    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

        <p>
            <strong> From my opinion, after having an idea or an image how the design should look like, creating
                HTML click-dummy usually goes quite smoothly. </strong> Of course you will find out that something
            in the wireframe
            which do not fit with real data and you need to do some adjustments, but the main direction won't change
            much in most of cases.
        </p>

        <p>
            The biggest issue I had in this design task is that there were too many things you could do with photos
            and too much info of photos you should show to users, plus photos themselves are colorful objects
            If I put everything on the surface like my original idea in the
            wirefames, it looks overwhelmed. That is also the main reason why I abandoned the card view before. But
            even for the list view, which has much more space, it looked crowded when I made most functionalities
            visible
            together with photos. <strong>I really want to give users an impression that, they can have a
            rest here, enjoy looking at beautiful images, take a pause from boring daily works. </strong>
            So finally, I decided to use a hover effect to hide most functions, and give user a clean view when
            they land on this page.

            without looking at the title, and it uses same design methodology with the design of photo list: more
            straight

            is just an condensed look of everything, at the same time providing an easy way to manage all media files at
            one time.

    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

        <p>
            After finished the design, I gave the click-dummy to a small group of people who use the old digital
            system daily, and let them play with it freely. The feedback was good. Not many changes during this
            phase were needed, only some small things were pointed out, for example,
            the color of the heart icon and the check icon were not bright enough. When a image had too many
            red/green colors, they were not obvious enough to identify. So I increased the contrast between the
            background grey and icons colors.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some bigger changes came after the development.<strong> With real data, performance were not as good as
            it showed in click-dummy. Sometimes, it is easier to improve it with better design than spending weeks
            kicking off the technical bottle nick</strong> For example, "marking as favorite" button, in
            click-dummy, users see feedback immediately, but in real world it usually takes 2 to 4 seconds to
            get response from server. So during these 2 to 4 seconds, users doesn't know what
            is happening. And they might click again and again on the icon, which of course causes troubles. To
            avoid the confusion, I add an small animation to the icon. After clicking, the icon will spin slowly
            until we get the response from server. <strong> Animation clearly tells users that the icon is already
            being clicked. At the same time, it brings fun.</strong> I found out that some users did enjoy clicking
            on it again and again just to see the animation.

                    This time I need to design a facebook game, it is very easy: divide one picture into 9 pieces. Every
                    5 seconds one piece is revealed, players need to guess what is it a photo of, basing on the visible
                    pieces. The faster they guess, the higher points they will get. The requirement of design is quite
                    simple: make it fit into the facebook canvas size, and picture should stand out.

                    <p>
                        There are several similar games in the market already. So before design I made a little
                        research, asked people to played those games and watched their behaviors. I found out one thing,
                        those kind of guessing game is quite difficult, most of the time, players don’t get the right
                        answer. And players are impatient, usually people give up after 3 - 5 wrong tries. On the other
                        hand, if it was too easy, people complained that the game is boring.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because I cannot really control what photo to show in the page, I decided to make the control
                        panel as simple as possible, when user look at the interface, only two places track their
                        attentions: the input field for typing answers and the skip button.

                    <p>
                        There was only thing which took me a little more time during the HTML creation time, the color
                        choosing problem. I had prepared several color patterns for the design: one is commonly used in
                        web games to create a happy atmosphere; one is the corporate color of my company; the last one
                        is gray, because no matter what the photo is, there wont be any uncomfortable contrast. At the
                        beginning I prefered to choose the happy mood color pattern, because when I applied others color
                        patterns, it doesn’t look like a game. But after trying with some very colorful photos, I gave
                        up this one, too many colors distract user from focused points. Then I decided to use the
                        corporate color. Because corporate color of my company is the stone blue, which is more vivid
                        comparing to gray.
                        them:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also wanted to make it more complicated, for example, background color changes basing on the
                        photo’s major color. Or the game color changes between male player and female player. I had
                        several ideas, but because we have limited development time, finally we agreed on one single
                        background color as you saw it now.

                    notification design. Each single time users login in, they will receive a big pop-up window, which
                    shows all unread notifications. Of course you can close popup easily by clicking on close button,
                    which is what most users do. But it repeatedly show up every 2 hours if you don't “dismiss” the
                    messages. The only way to dismiss it is to click on the gear mean and then choose “ mark as read ”
                    for each single message you’ve received.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After month and month, you might get a list of 100 messages which show up every 2 hours. If I was
                    the customer, I would kill the page immediately and blame the system of stopping me from working.

                    Due to some organization issues, I was the Product Owner of Notification Center, and then take over
                    the design task after a while. So keeping the balance of caring about functions and paying more
                    attention to designs becomes the biggest challenge for this task.

                    <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        As a general method I usually use to design a new product. I asked myself 3 questions. Whom am I
                        design this product for ? What’s their problems? What functionality I can provide to solve their
                        Problems?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here came this base document which I used as an instruction for design.
                    </p>
                    <img src="./img/notification-center/functional-bits.jpg"
                         alt="functional bits of notification center">

                    <p>
                        <br>There are four main issues:
                        <br>1. Number of notifications grows too fast
                        <br>2. Too many error messages
                        <br>3. Notifications cannot be easily dismissed
                        <br>4. User preferences are different
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For the first problem, it is not really a design issue. I solved it by changing most
                        notification into flash message alert, because there are a lot of notifications which are just
                        feedback info after some immediate action.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For the second one, it is both functional issue and design issue. What is definition of error
                        message? How to display the error message, so that it could get user’s attention, at the same
                        time avoid being annoying. In our case, we degraded some error messages to warning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The third one is definitely a design problem. Mark as read should be the easiest task ever, one
                        click, it’s done.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For the last one, we need a new functional improvement, which allows user to freely choose which
                        kind of notification they want to receive, and in what kind of way, notification inbox, pop-up,
                        or email ?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After analysed these problems, I made another list: expected result/functions. And then mapped
                        them with the problems, to make sure that all problems are covered.

                    <p>
                        The design parts went really smoothly, because the previous designer @Stefan, left a really good
                        template here. I Didn't change the listview style a lot. Just added some functional icons which
                        indicate users what they can do there. Same style/behavior was applied as Digital Management
                        System, so that the consistency in system was kept.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since I already have matured idea of what to do and a half-backed HTML design, I didn't do
                        sketching this time. Directly changed ideas into a HTML click dummy.

                        <strong>Mark:</strong> As the said before, users of ASMS has 4 problems with the old
                        notifications. All of them are solved in the new design. Users can see mark more than one
                        notifications as read at once easily. User can mute one type of notifications. Or user can alter
                        notifications to make them show up in pop-ups. So that they won't miss any in any important
                        notification and they won't be annoyed by unwanted notification neither.

                <p>
                    IBE, so called International Booking Engine is widely used by travel agencies across Europe. The
                    goal is to make the booking process more social for travellers, to allow them to share booking
                    information easily and by that drive more traffic to the travel agency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The task was to create a responsible web page to display basic information about a flight booking.
                    The page should show the price of the flight at the time of sharing and allow user to check the
                    current price.

                <p>
                    We want travellers to share and visit the page as much as possible, so the page must have a modern
                    and attractive design. But the information we get from the booking engine is hardly rich: departure
                    and destination airports, price, flight time - that’s all. How to use so little data to create a
                    rich experience was the biggest challenge.

                    <p>
                        In order to encourage users to share the page, we need to provide what they want. I asked
                        myself: why would a user want to share a booking information? In my opinion , there are three
                        main scenarios, or use-cases, as explained in the storytelling graph below:
                    </p>

                         alt="snapshot story telling">

                    <p>
                        1. It is a group trip, information needs to be shared among all travellers. In this case, the
                        time of travel and price of the flight are the critical data.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        2. User wants more friends to join the trip, so a welcoming photo of the destination, to be
                        shared again by friends of friends, is good idea. Of course, price and travel dates are
                        important as well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        3. User doesn't know where to go, so she/he just shares something to get inspiration. For this
                        scenario, a nice photo and a place where friends can make comments and discuss the trip become
                        more important.

                    <p>
                        As a first step of trying to satisfy all three requirements, I made a sketch - see the picture
                        below.

                        In short, I wanted to show who has shared this pre-ticket and to display all the basic
                        information in a central place. The background should be a nice image of the travel destination.
                        A facebook comment box and several share buttons should be available in the footer. </p>
                    <img src="./img/snapshot/sketch-snapshot.jpg"
                         alt="snapshot story telling">

                    <p>
                        After having this first idea, I needed to do some research. First, where could I get background
                        photos? Second, is it legal to store facebook user data. Unfortunately the answers for both
                        questions were no: it is too expensive to buy images and the image quality cannot be guaranteed
                        if we use images available online randomly, and there might be legal issues.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because of that I had to make another design. I simplified the page to make it look more like a
                        ticket, while adding some decorations around it to make sure it doesn't look boring at the same
                        time. Then, basing on this, I created a design for the mobile version too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The next step was actual HTML page creation.

                        In order to write a well structured css, I decided to make mobile version first. The mobile
                        styles has the base css, the bigger screen it grows, the more codes will be add. Please see the
                        result there.

                        flying in sky.The arrow icon is animated to attract user to click on it. The price is shown on
                        the right hand side, in a font size big enough to make it obvious. A lot paper tickets has
                        similar design. The “Check Current Price” button will navigate user to the real booking site for
                        this offer. The footer part shows relevant contact information - if travellers have any doubts
                        they can use those information to contact agencies easily.
